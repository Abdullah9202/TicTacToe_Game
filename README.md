# Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains the source code for a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++ using the wxWidgets library.

## Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using wxWidgets.
- Dynamic grid layout with resizable window support.
- Real-time feedback on game status, including win, draw, and current player turn.
- Easy-to-understand game logic implemented with simple C++ code.

## Compatibility

**Note**: This project is developed and tested using Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition. To run the project, ensure that you have wxWidgets configured with your Visual Studio environment.

## Files

1. **MainFrame.h**: Header file containing the declaration of the `TicTacToeFrame` class, which represents the main frame of the game.

2. **MainFrame.cpp**: Source file containing the implementation of the `TicTacToeFrame` class, including event handlers for button clicks and game logic.

3. **App.h**: Header file containing the declaration of the `TicTacToeApp` class, which represents the application itself.

4. **App.cpp**: Source file containing the implementation of the `TicTacToeApp` class, including the application initialization.

5. **Header.h**: Header file containing the necessary include directives for wxWidgets library.

## Usage

To use the Tic Tac Toe game, simply compile the source files using Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition with wxWidgets configured. Once compiled, run the executable to play the game.
